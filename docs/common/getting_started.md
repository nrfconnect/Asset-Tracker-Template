# Getting Started

To get started with Asset tracker template, you need to set up the development environment, build the application, and run it on supported hardware.
You can use any of the following tools, depending on your preferred development environment:

* Using Visual Studio Code and the [nRF Connect for VS Code extension](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-connect-vscode/page/index.html)
* Using command line and nRF Util

In nRF Connect for VS Code, the Asset Tracker Template is available as an add-on in the **Create New Application** menu:

![Create New Application menu](../images/create_new_app.png)

Select the **Browse nRF Connect SDK add-on Index** option and search for **Asset Tracker Template**.

![Asset Tracker Template add-on](../images/addon_att.png)

For more details on how to use the VS Code extension, refer to the [nRF Connect for VS Code documentation](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-connect-vscode/page/index.html).

## Prerequisites

* **The nRF Util command line tool and the SDK manager command**

    1. Install nRF Util by following the instructions in the [nRF Util documentation](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrfutil/page/guides/installing.html).
    1. Install the SDK manager command by following the instructions in the [sdk-manager command](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrfutil/page/nrfutil-sdk-manager/nrfutil-sdk-manager.html) documentation.

* **nRF Connect SDK toolchain v3.0.0 or later**

    - Follow the instructions in the [sdk-manager command](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrfutil/page/nrfutil-sdk-manager/nrfutil-sdk-manager.html) documentation to install v3.0.0 of the nRF Connect SDK toolchain.

## Supported boards

The Asset Tracker Template is continuously verified in CI on the following boards:

- **[Thingy:91 X](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Nordic-Thingy-91-X)**

    - Build target `thingy91x/nrf9151/ns`

- **[nRF9151 DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF9151-DK)**

    - Build target `nrf9151dk/nrf9151/ns`

## Workspace Initialization

Before initializing, start the toolchain environment:

```shell
nrfutil sdk-manager toolchain launch --ncs-version v3.0.0 --shell
```

Alternatively, you can run the command with a specific nRF Connect SDK version. For example, if you are using version 3.0.1, run:

```shell
nrfutil sdk-manager toolchain launch --ncs-version v3.0.0 -- <your command>
```

To run for instance the `west` command with the specified version of toolchain. You can create an alias or shell function for this command to avoid typing it in full every time.

In this document, the `nrfutil toolchain-manager launch --shell` variant is used to launch the toolchain environment in the shell.

To initialize the workspace folder (`asset-tracker-template`) where the firmware project and all nRF Connect SDK modules will be cloned, run the following commands:

```shell
# Initialize asset-tracker-template workspace
west init -m https://github.com/nrfconnect/Asset-Tracker-Template.git --mr main asset-tracker-template

cd asset-tracker-template

# Update nRF Connect SDK modules. This may take a while.
west update
```

The template repository is now cloned into the `asset-tracker-template` folder, the west modules are downloaded, and you are ready to build the project.

## Building and running

Complete the following steps for building and running using command line:

1. Navigate to the application folder:

    ```shell
    # Assuming you are in the asset-tracker-template folder
    cd project/app
    ```

1. To build the application, run the following command:

    ```shell
    west build -p -b thingy91x/nrf9151/ns # Pristine build
    ```

1. When using the serial bootloader on Thingy:91 X, you can update the application using the following command:

    ```shell
    west thingy91x-dfu
    ```

1. When using nRF9151 DK or an external debugger on Thingy:91 X, you can program the device using the following command:

    ```shell
    west flash --erase # The --erase option is optional and will erase the entire flash memory before programming
    ```

The application is now built and flashed to the device. You can open a serial terminal to see the logs from Test that it all works the application. The default baud rate is 115200. It is recommended to use the Serial Terminal app, which you can install from [nRF Connect for Desktop](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-Desktop). You can also use other serial terminal applications like PuTTY, Tera Term, or minicom.

### Builing with overlays

You can build the application with different overlays to enable or disable certain features. The following are some examples of how to build the application with different overlays.

Debug build with Memfault:

```shell
west build -p -b thingy91x/nrf9151/ns -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE="overlay-memfault.conf;overlay-upload-modem-traces-to-memfault.conf;overlay-etb.conf" -DCONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_PROJECT_KEY=\"memfault-project-key\"
```

Build with Memfault, sending modem traces to Memfault and enabling ETB traces:

```shell
west build -p -b thingy91x/nrf9151/ns -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE="overlay-memfault.conf;overlay-upload-modem-traces-to-memfault.conf" -DCONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_PROJECT_KEY=\"memfault-project-key\"
```

## Provision device to nRF Cloud

To be able to use the [nRF Cloud](https://nrfcloud.com) features, you need to provision your device to nRF Cloud and associate it with your account. The following steps will guide you through the provisioning process, using [nRF Cloud Utils](https://github.com/nRFCloud/utils/tree/main).

### Requirements

Ensure you have an active [nRF Cloud](https://nrfcloud.com) account. If not, register at [nrfcloud.com](https://nrfcloud.com).
To locate your API key:

1. Log in to your nRF Cloud account.
1. Click the menu icon (often referred to as a "burger icon") in the top-right corner.
1. Navigate to your user account details. Your API key will be listed there.
If you are a member of multiple teams on nRF Cloud, each team will have a distinct API key. Verify you are using the API key associated with the correct team.

The following provisioning steps require that the Asset Tracker Template application has been successfully built and flashed to your device. If you have not yet completed this, refer to the [Building and running](#building-and-running) section.

Install nrfcloud-utils package:

```shell
pip3 install nrfcloud-utils
```

Refer to the [nRF Cloud Utils](https://github.com/nRFCloud/utils/tree/main) documentation for more information on the commands and their usage.

### Steps

Provisioning the device involves writing credentials to the nRF91 Series device. To do so, LTE needs to be disabled.
Open device shell through serial and set network disconnect mode using the following command:

```shell
att_network disconnect
```

nRF Cloud Utils communicates with the device over the serial port, so you need to disconnect from the serial port before proceeding with the next steps.
Refer to the [nRF Cloud Utils](https://github.com/nRFCloud/utils/tree/main) documentation for more information on the commands, their usage and the available options.

Create a self-signed CA certificate and private key:

```shell
create_ca_cert
```

Now, you should have three `.pem` files containing the key pair and the CA certificate of your local certificate authority. The files are named as follows:

- `*_ca.pem` - CA certificate
- `*_prv.pem` - CA private key
- `*_pub.pem` - CA public key

Install credentials onto the device:

```shell
device_credentials_installer -d --ca *_ca.pem --ca-key *_prv.pem --coap --cmd-type at_shell
```

Upon success, you can find an `onboard.csv` file with information about your device. You need this file to register the certificate with your account.
In this step, you will also be prompted to enter your nRF Cloud API key that you obtained earlier.

```shell
nrf_cloud_onboard --api-key $NRFCLOUD_API_KEY --csv onboard.csv
```

Your device should now be registered to your account on nRF Cloud.

## Testing

To test that everything is working as expected, you can do the following:

1. In a web browser, navigate to [nRF Cloud](https://nrfcloud.com) and log in to your account. Navigate to the **Device management** menu and select **Devices**. You should now see your device listed in the device overview. Click on the device ID to see the device page.

    ![nRF Cloud device management menu](../images/nrfcloud_devices.png)

1. Connect to the device using the serial terminal and reset the device using either the reset button or the following shell command:

    ```shell
    kernel reboot
    ```

1. In the serial terminal, you will see the device booting up and connecting to the network. The device tries to connect to nRF Cloud using the credentials you provided during provisioning.
