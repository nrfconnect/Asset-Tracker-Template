This file contains instructions for an AI agent in how to build Nordic DevAcademy course on Asset Tracker Template (ATT).

ATT course should fit with DevAcademy style and architecture. It should be very close to Cellular Dev Academy course.
A sort of integration of the Cellular Course. But it makes sense to have a separate course for ATT given its scope.


The agent reading this should heavily rely on nordic-db-mpc, an MPC that has access to Dev Academy documentation and sources.

The agent should populate the devacademy folder with the course content.

The agent should keep iterating until completion of the task.

Focus on simplicity and little verbosity.

It should be user frendly and rewarding for user.
