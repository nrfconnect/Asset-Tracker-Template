## Context

I need to create a comprehensive Nordic Developer Academy course on the Asset Tracker Template (ATT). 
I have drafted initial course creation instructions in @DEVACADEMY.txt that will guide an AI agent 
in building this course content.

## Request

Please help me refine and enhance the DEVACADEMY.txt rules 
to ensure the AI agent can produce high-quality DevAcademy-style content.

## Analysis Approach

Please:
1. Read and analyze the current DEVACADEMY.txt rules thoroughly
2. Use nordic-db-mcp to research authentic DevAcademy course characteristics
3. Cross-reference with ATT documentation and codebase structure
4. Identify gaps, ambiguities, or areas needing improvement
5. Provide specific, actionable recommendations for enhancement

## Desired Outcome

An improved DEVACADEMY.txt that serves as a guide for an AI agent 
to create professional-quality Nordic Developer Academy course.
